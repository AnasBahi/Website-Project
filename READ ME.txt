Hello,

the inspiration behind this project was Nordsee as you can tell

with many of its customers being retirees first, who are mainly customers with low search costs, 

we decided to portray a usage for Price Differentiation.

The premise of our mock site is an easy to use online platform for ordering food, whereby the main targeted customers are seniors, 

who look for discounts, and prioritize simplicity, convenience and familiarity.

in addition to Seniors, Students, who are also as a customer base tend to seek discounts, could also be targeted for random discounts 

with the goal of customer retention and loyalty.

By DEFAULT the following "Coupons" are available to use for testing, with the idea that in live service, the codes would be checked against

existing databases via requests:

-  123456789: For retires (placeholder for a Senior citizen's social security number)
  
-  FSUJENA: for students (placeholder for a third party verified student ID)

-  OSTESEE10: placeholder for a random discount coupon.
